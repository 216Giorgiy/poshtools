New poshtools Repo

You may have noticed a fork of the adamdriscoll/poshtools repo as well as a number of new contributors from Microsoft.  Over the past few weeks we’ve been working with Adam to see how we can collaborate on the extension and contribute to the project.  He’s done a lot in the extension for a single dev working in his spare time and we’d like to help out in some areas we’ve been getting feedback on…  Trying to put PowerShell support in VS on par with other languages.  This doesn’t change anything in PowerShell itself, we’re just augmenting support for PowerShell in VS.

For now, we want to keep a separate repo for this work because some of the changes may be more involved but we’d still like to get feedback on the code as we develop it.  So if you want to watch, comment or consume, let us know what you think.

Thanks
Brian Moore, Program Manager – Microsoft
